- What is DNS do and how does work?
    - It functions like a phonebook for domain names and IP addresses: it resolves domain names to IP addresses
    - When you type a website like yahoo. com or so in a web browser, the computer will first look for the IP address in its own cache memory. If it can’t find it, it will send a request for the IP to the resolver which is the ISP server.
    - The ISP will look in its own cache and if it sill can’t find the IP matching said domain, it will ask the next level which is the root server
    - Root servers are the top most in the DNS hierarchy. There are 13 sets of root servers places in different parts of the world and handles by 12 different organizations. These root servers each have their own IP addresses.
    - When the resolver asks for an IP matching a domain, the root server won’t know, but it will reroute the resolver to the server of the top level domain, which in our case is the .com servers. TLDs can be .com .org .edu etc and many others for country domains like .us .ca .in etc
    - the TLDs will also not know the IP for yahoo, but it will send the resolver to the authoritative name servers. These servers are the final authority and will know the IP of yahoo .com and will send it to resolver.
    - Resolver will get back to our computer and the page will load. Now the cache memory will store this information so the next time it doesn’t have to go through the whole process and loads quickly.
- Explain parts of a FQDN
    
    Example: www. google. com
    
    - .com = TLD ie top level domain
    - google = domain name
    - www = sub domain aka host
- What is managed and unmanaged switch?
    - Managed are those that can be given an IP address so that you can communicate with the switch to set up things like VLANs
    - Unmanaged are cheaper and don’t have this feature
- Expand VLAN
    
    Virtual Local Area Network
    
- What is VLAN and how does it work?
    - VLAN is a technology that enables creating multiple LANs without adding hardware.
    - You can set certain ports in a switch to mean a certain LAN (VLAN1) and a few others to mean another LAN (VLAN2).
    - And the devices plugged into those particular ports, despite being on the same physical location and plugged into the same switch cannot talk to each other because they are all on different networks.
    - VLANs are used by small to medium businesses to separate different networks without adding firewalls, routers, and separating their devices physically
