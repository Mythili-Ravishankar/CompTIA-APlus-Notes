- What is a switch?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect 2 computers on a LAN. Apart from detecting computers connected to it, it can also read and store the MAC addresses of the computers plugged in.
    
- What is a hub?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect 2 computers on a LAN. It is not intelligent and it can only detect a device connected to it and not much else. 
    
- What is the difference between a switch and a hub?
    
    Both are network devices that help connect computers on a LAN only.
    
    Let’s say there are 4 computers A-D on a LAN connected by a hub. 
    
    A wants to send data to D. The hub repeats the data and sends it to all B,C,D. The computers will read the destination MAC on the data and know if it is for them or not. So, B and C will erase the data while D will retain it. 
    Because of this process, not only are there security concerns, but it also reduces the bandwidth of computers to communicate with.
    
    Now imagine the same scenario but the computers are connected by a switch.
    The switch not only detects the computers connected to it, but can also register the MAC addresses of the computers. 
    
    Now, when A wants to send data to D, it only sends the data to the port in which D is connected, thereby not wasting bandwidth in repeating the data to non-destination computers. 
    
    In today’s world. You will most likely use a switch to connected computers on a LAN and not a hub. 
    
    TLDR:
    
    - hub can’t read MAC, switch can
    - hub repeats data, switch doesn’t
    - hubs hogs bandwidth, switch doesn’t
    - today you would mostly use a switch and not a hub for LAN connections
- What are some places hexadecimal is used?
    
    MAC, IPv6, hex codes, Unicide
    
- What is a router?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect computers on different networks. It is intelligent and can read the IP addresses of different devices connected to it. Using this, it determines when a packet of data is destined to one of the devices on its own network or outside. The router is usually called the default gateway outside its network on to the outside internet. 
    
    Hubs and switches *create* networks.
    
    Routers *connect* networks.
    
- Explain the types of ethernet twisted pair cables and how you would connect and make them functional
    - They come in 2 types - UTP and STP.
    - They have 4 pairs of twisted wires in 4 colours - orange, brown, blue, green and the striped versions of these. So each cable will have 8 wires in total twisted around each other.
    - STP has a protective foil around the wires to prevent leakage of electromagnetic interference into and out of the wires.
    - To make cables, you have to buy TP in bulk and then wire then in the correct order and then attach RJ-45 connectors to the ends.
    - First, you would use a cable stripper to remove the protective sheath around the wires and then arrange them in the right order. Then you would put them into a wire crimper to attach the RJ-45 connector to them.
- What is 568A and 568B and their wire order?
    
    Both are standards for wiring cables based on their colour.  The order is as follows:
    
    ![Untitled](A+%20b6a00c24ad504ff9b63afc66a2c2b001/Untitled.png)
    
    ![Untitled](A+%20b6a00c24ad504ff9b63afc66a2c2b001/Untitled%201.png)
    
    Some tips to remember the order:
    
    - Both start with a white stripe and alternate with the solid colours.
    - Both are same except swap the oranges and greens. ie if the colour name starts with a B, it stays in the same place for both standards.
    - Blue = 4,5 Brown = 7,8. So in the remaining slots of 1 2 3 6, the remaining have to fit
    - Now, A and B in alphabetical order, so Green and Orange also in alphabetical order
    - So for A, start with green stripe, green, orange stripe, 4,5, orange, 7,8
    - For B, start with orange stripe, orange, green stripe, 4,5, green, 7,8
- What is straight and crossover cables?
      If both ends of the cable are wired using the same standard then this is  known as a straight cable aka patch cable. This is used to connect dissimilar devices like a computer to a switch, a router, a modem, etc.

  If both ends of the cable are wired using the same standard then this is known as a crossover cable. This is used to connect similar devices like a computer to a computer or a router to a router.

- What is a patch panel?
    
    It’s an assembly of ports used to connect and manage incoming and outgoing LAN cables. It helps keep large number of cables organized in an office setup or anywhere where there are lots of network connections.
    
- Explain the structured cabling method
    
    Ethernet cable runs from the switch to patch panel, and from there to the different wall outlets in the building. Computers connect to these outlets for their networks.
    
- What does a 110 Punchdown tool do?
    
    It helps punch in wires into a patch panel
    
- What is a cable tester?
    
    It’s used to verify continuity - if the cable is connected end to end
    
    And it tests if we have fixed the wires in order
    
- What is a tone generator (fox and hound)
    
    It is used to trace cables from one end to the other. If you have a cable somewhere in the wall and want to find its other end in a patch panel, then you connect the tone generator to the cable, and it will make a sound that will pass all the way to the other end. Use the probe at the other end to identify the sound and hence the cable
    
- What is TDR - time domain reflectometer?
    
    It is used to test co-ax and TP cables. A signal is passed through the cable and reflected back to the TDR. It analyses the reflected cable to pinpoint any problems like loose connectors, crimps, breaks, bends, etc.
    
    Optical TDR is same thing but uses light and so is used for fiber optic cables.
    
- What is a RJ-45 loopback adapter?
    
    It’s a handy tool to test problems with network ports. The wires in the adapter are arranged in a way that the signal transmitted is looped back into the same connector to complete the circuit. 
    
    To use this, plug it into the wall jack or wherever you wanted to test. If the corresponding link light on the switch lights up, then you can be sure that the cable, switch, and the wall jack are working fine. If not, there’s a problem somewhere.
    
- What’s a buttset?
    
    A tool resembling a telephone. A telephone operator will plug it into any phone line to check for noises or other disturbances. 
    
- What is a multimeter?
    
    It tests electrical circuits. It can check power, voltage, continuity, etc
    
- What is half duplex and full duplex?
    
    They both are transmission types used in networking. 
    
    Half duplex is when 2 devices connected by a network cable can talk to each other but not at the same time. They can do only one direction at a time. If A and B want to talk, A will talk, B will wait till A is done, and only then respond. 
    
    But in full duplex, they can communicate with each other at the same time in both directions. 
    
    The duplex and the speed of the NIC and the switch or whatever it is connected to must always match. Usually this is auto-negotiated and very rarely you may have to go manually changing this. 
    
- What is Wake on LAN?
    
    It’s a network adapter setting where you can remotely turn on a computer by another computer on the same LAN by sending a magic packet to it. The magic packet contains the destination MAC of the device. So when the NIC in a sleeping computer suddenly hears a magic packet with its own MAC, it wakes up the computer. 
    
- What are ethernet link lights
    
    They are lights that indicate connection, speed and activity.
    
    Connection and speed are often indicated by the same light. If it is on, it is connected, and depending on the color of the light, you can know the speed, this changes for different manufacturers.
    
    The other light is activity. It keeps flickering to show activity happening through the cable.
