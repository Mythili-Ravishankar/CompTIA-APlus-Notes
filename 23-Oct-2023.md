- What is a switch?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect 2 computers on a LAN. Apart from detecting computers connected to it, it can also read and store the MAC addresses of the computers plugged in.
    
- What is a hub?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect 2 computers on a LAN. It is not intelligent and it can only detect a device connected to it and not much else. 
    
- What is the difference between a switch and a hub?
    
    Both are network devices that help connect computers on a LAN only.
    
    Let’s say there are 4 computers A-D on a LAN connected by a hub. 
    
    A wants to send data to D. The hub repeats the data and sends it to all B,C,D. The computers will read the destination MAC on the data and know if it is for them or not. So, B and C will erase the data while D will retain it. 
    Because of this process, not only are there security concerns, but it also reduces the bandwidth of computers to communicate with.
    
    Now imagine the same scenario but the computers are connected by a switch.
    The switch not only detects the computers connected to it, but can also register the MAC addresses of the computers. 
    
    Now, when A wants to send data to D, it only sends the data to the port in which D is connected, thereby not wasting bandwidth in repeating the data to non-destination computers. 
    
    In today’s world. You will most likely use a switch to connected computers on a LAN and not a hub. 
    
    TLDR:
    
    - hub can’t read MAC, switch can
    - hub repeats data, switch doesn’t
    - hubs hogs bandwidth, switch doesn’t
    - today you would mostly use a switch and not a hub for LAN connections

- What is a router?
    
    It is a networking hardware device that helps connect computers on different networks. It is intelligent and can read the IP addresses of different devices connected to it. Using this, it determines when a packet of data is destined to one of the devices on its own network or outside. The router is usually called the default gateway outside its network on to the outside internet. 
    
    Hubs and switches *create* networks.
    
    Routers *connect* networks.
    
- Explain the types of ethernet twisted pair cables and how you would connect and make them functional
    - They come in 2 types - UTP and STP.
    - They have 4 pairs of twisted wires in 4 colours - orange, brown, blue, green and the striped versions of these. So each cable will have 8 wires in total twisted around each other.
    - STP has a protective foil around the wires to prevent leakage of electromagnetic interference into and out of the wires.
    - To make cables, you have to buy TP in bulk and then wire then in the correct order and then attach RJ-45 connectors to the ends.
    - First, you would use a cable stripper to remove the protective sheath around the wires and then arrange them in the right order. Then you would put them into a wire crimper to attach the RJ-45 connector to them.
- What is 568A and 568B and their wire order?
    
    Both are standards for wiring cables based on their colour.  The order is as follows:
    
    ![Untitled](A+%20b6a00c24ad504ff9b63afc66a2c2b001/Untitled.png)
    
    ![Untitled](A+%20b6a00c24ad504ff9b63afc66a2c2b001/Untitled%201.png)
    
    Some tips to remember the order:
    
    - Both start with a white stripe and alternate with the solid colours.
    - Both are same except swap the oranges and greens. ie if the colour name starts with a B, it stays in the same place for both standards.
    - Blue = 4,5 Brown = 7,8. So in the remaining slots of 1 2 3 6, the remaining have to fit
    - Now, A and B in alphabetical order, so Green and Orange also in alphabetical order
    - So for A, start with green stripe, green, orange stripe, 4,5, orange, 7,8
    - For B, start with orange stripe, orange, green stripe, 4,5, green, 7,8
