- What are coaxial cables?
    - copper networking cables
    - called so because 2 or more things share the same axis
    - usually used for cable TC or modem, it’s for sending internet through cable and uses RG-6 type of coax

- What is plenum
    - it’s the specified area above the drop ceiling where the hot air from the building all collects - shared air space
    - this area is also shared by the building’s network cables
    - during fire, we need the wires not to produce toxic fumes so we need plenum rated cables
    - traditional jacket of cables is made of PVC which are more flexible but not safe in fires
    - fire rated are made of FEP (fluorinated ethylene polymer) or low-smoke PVC
- STP UTP nomenclature
    - U = unshielded
    - S = braided shield
    - F = foil shield
    - format: overall cable/individual pairs TP
    - this is F/UTP

    - this is S/FTP

- Direct burial STP
    - when you want to bury cables directly in the ground without conduit
    - always STP because they are more protected from interference and have more strength
    - cross section of direct burial STP

- Categories of fiber optic cable
    
    Multimode 
    
    - thick core
    - short range, ~2km
    - light bounces multiple times before reaching destination
    - cheap light source like LED

    Single mode
    
    - very thin core
    - long range, upto 100km
    - light goes straight to destination
    - costly light source like lasers

- What are the purposes of virtualization?
    1. Legacy software and OS: if an application runs on some old OS, use a VM to use that OS and run the app and use the latest or desired OS on your actual host computer
    2. Cross-platform: run multiple OSs simultaneously, save resources and time, move seamlessly between OSs
    3. Sandboxing: isolated testing envt, no connection to real world so no consequences, try code, break code, nobody gets hurt. You can also take snapshots of prev versions and roll back to them in case something goes wrong
- What are the resource requirements for virtualization?
    - CPU: Intel - Virtualization Technology (VT), If AMD then AMD-V
    - RAM: have above and beyond the host’s requirements
    - Disk space: to store OS images and data
    - Network: configure each guest as required
- What are the security requirements for virtualization?
    1. Hypervisor security:
        1. VM escaping: Malware compromises hypervisor and jumps from one guest OS to another
        2. if many customers are hosted on a single hypervisor, it can steal data from all of them if compromised
    2. Guest OS security:
        1. Use traditional security measures just like you would for a regular computer like firewall, anti-virus etc
        2. Don’t trust 3rd party built VMs because they could be rogue and steal stuff from your host as well
- What are the network requirements for virtualization?
    1. Shared network address: guest uses same as host, has a private address internally 
    2. Bridged network: separate IP, works just like regular IP on a regular computer
    3. Private address: like APIPA, no communication with internet but yes with internal; network devices 
    

- BSOD
    - Actual name is Windows stop error
    - This could be because of bad hardware/drivers/application
    - Things you could do are use last know good mode or safe mode
    - maybe reseat hardware, maybe they are not fitted properly
- Spinning ball of death
    - Mac - cursor freezes into this ball and could potentially get stuck there and restarting is the only way to regain control over the computer
    - could be many reasons, check event logs
- Black screen
    - most basic: is the monitor connected? check power and signal cables
    - most basic: check brightness, maybe it’s working but too dim
    - make sure you have selected the appropriate input so the computer knows where to take the signal from (ie VGA, DVI, etc)
    - swap and check with another monitor to check cables
    - Use VGA mode in Windows: generic graphic mode which works with all monitors: will know if it’s a monitor issue or driver issue
- No power
    - again check basic: is it connected properly?
    - use multimeter to see if socket is the problem
    - see if other things like fans, lights are working
- Sluggish performance
    - check task manager: maybe too many apps, CPU high usage
    - maybe update running in the background
    - maybe low disk space
    - maybe virus, scan for bad guys
    - maybe low battery and power saving mode
- Overheating
    - clean insides, allow air flow
    - verify internal temp with monitoring software
- Burning smell
    - electrical problems
    - disconnect power immediately
    - look at cooling components and replace damages
- Intermittent shut down
    - check logs
    - could be heat issue
    - could be a single hardware issue: check device manager
    - could be anything pretty much
- Application crashes
    - look for error message
    - check logs
    - check reliability monitor
    - reinstall app
