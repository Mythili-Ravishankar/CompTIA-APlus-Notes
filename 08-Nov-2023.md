- What is a file server?
    - centralized storage which has many folders for you to store your info
    - because they are stored on network, access from anywhere
    - OS has a way to communicate with this file server which is SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows and Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) for Apple
    - user has no idea because front-end hides protocols, end users can do anything like copy delete rename edit etc etc without worrying about what’s happening BTS
- What is a print server?
    - hardware or software that helps connect printer to network so everyone can access it
    - this could be a software on a computer, all the print jobs go to this computer and printer takes this info from here to completed the job
    - could be hardware like a network card to connect directly to network
    - could also have wireless capabilities to print over wifi
    - protocols include SMB, IPP (internet printing protocol), LPD (line printer daemon)
- What is syslog
    - there is logging info on every computer, but instead of having to access each individually, the syslog protocols consolidates all of them centrally
    - basically its a centralized logging database to which you can send all your logs
    - integrated into SIEM (Security information and event manager)
    - it has very large disk space to accommodate all this info
- How are web pages built usually?
    
    HTML or HTML 5
    
- Expand AAA
    
    Authentication Authorization Accounting
    
- Authentication server
    - centralized server that has usernames, passwords and other authentication information for different people and different services
    - typically used in enterprises and not homes since the latter doesn’t have that much info to store
- What are spam gateways?
    - a separate place where mails suspected to be spam go
    - they will be examined there and make their way into to internal network only if safe and relevant, else will stay there and eventually get deleted
- Expand UTM
    
    Unifies threat management
    
- What is UTM
    - all-in-one security appliance
    - think of it as a next gen firewall
    - performs multiple functions like
        - URL filtering
        - content inspection for malware
        - spam filter
        - router and switch functions
        - firewall
        - bandwidth shaper (to prioritize bandwidth for different tasks)
        - VPN end point
        - Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- What is a load balancer?
    - helps distributes load among different servers so that there is constant availability
    - checks in with serves and if one becomes unresponsive, it removes it and continues operating with remaining
- Features of load balancer
    - configures load on different servers
    - TCP and SSL offloading
    - caching for fast response
    - Prioritization for certain types of traffic
    - content switching: application centric balancing among servers
- Expand SCADA
    
    Supervisory control and data acquisition
    
    aka ICS (industrial control system)
    
- SCADA
    - used for managing specific industrial equipment like power generation equipment, manufacturing equipment, etc
    - have ability to view activities and status real-time for better control
    - requires extensive segmentation so they are on their own network separated from the rest. This is because any problem with this affects large amounts of systems and will be difficult to resolve
- What are legacy systems?
    - once a service is installed in a data center, it’s very hard to remove it
    - they are very old systems, but still have some important service running on them
    - they may have these services running on a very old software or hardware and hence hard to repair
 
- What is the difference between a private and a public IP address?
    - private is the address given to your computer and you use this to talk to other devices on the same network
    - public is the one you use to talk to the internet, this is the router’s IP address, as the router is the one taking your request outside your local network
- What is static and dynamic addressing?
    - dynamic is given by DHCP, this can change within the range and also according to leases
    - static is when you want a certain device to always have the same IP address, so you turn off DHCP for it and give it the address you want, but this is not preferred, instead use DHCP with reservations for this
- What is the command to find out the IP of a domain name?
    - dig
    - nslookup
- What is a DNS record?
    - A DNS record is a piece of information in a database that links a URL to an IP address. They are in the form of text instructions stored on the DNS servers for linking IP to name
- Name some DNS record types
    - Address records: A, AAAA
    - CName
    - MX
    - TXT
- What all maybe there in a DNS record?
    - Type (A, AAAA, MX, etc)
    - Domain name
    - IP address
    - TTL = time to live, ie how long the record is valid until next update
- DNS address records
    - A is to map IPv4 to domain name
    - AAAA (quad A) is IPv6 to domain name
- DNS CNAME record
    - resolves domain or subdomain name to a domain name
    - basically has records of aliases so that www. something . com and something. com all go to the same place
- DNS MX record
    - mail exchanger record
    - points to server where email should be forwarded
    - they usually have >1 record according to priority for redundancy
- DNS TXT record
    - contains misc info about a domain like general info/contact etc
    - human readable info
    - can be used for verification purpose
    
- Expand SPF record
    
    Sender policy framework
    
- SPF record
    - list of all servers authorized to send emails for the domain
    - for eg nobody can randomly send an email from xyz@amazon.com
    - the server that receives the mail checks with the DNS of the FQDN and see if it really came from the host and only then sends it along to the next destination
- Expand DKIM
    
    domain keys identidied mail
    
- DKIM record
    - digital signature for a domain’s outgoing email which is validated by the mail server and invisible to end-user
    - the public key for the signature is in the DKIM TXT record
- Expand DMARC
    
    domain-based message authentication reporting and conformance
    
- DMARC record
    - what if the verification in DKIM and SPF fails?
    - the DMARC contains policies on what to do in such a case
    - you can choose to accept all, or send to spam, or reject the email
    - and based on the reports from analysing multiple emails that failed the tests, you can take further steps
- What is common to SPF, DKIM, DMARC
    - all are anti spoof email methods
