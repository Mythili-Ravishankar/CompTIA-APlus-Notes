- What is a file server?
    - centralized storage which has many folders for you to store your info
    - because they are stored on network, access from anywhere
    - OS has a way to communicate with this file server which is SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows and Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) for Apple
    - user has no idea because front-end hides protocols, end users can do anything like copy delete rename edit etc etc without worrying about what’s happening BTS
- What is a print server?
    - hardware or software that helps connect printer to network so everyone can access it
    - this could be a software on a computer, all the print jobs go to this computer and printer takes this info from here to completed the job
    - could be hardware like a network card to connect directly to network
    - could also have wireless capabilities to print over wifi
    - protocols include SMB, IPP (internet printing protocol), LPD (line printer daemon)
- What is syslog
    - there is logging info on every computer, but instead of having to access each individually, the syslog protocols consolidates all of them centrally
    - basically its a centralized logging database to which you can send all your logs
    - integrated into SIEM (Security information and event manager)
    - it has very large disk space to accommodate all this info
- How are web pages built usually?
    
    HTML or HTML 5
    
- Expand AAA
    
    Authentication Authorization Accounting
    
- Authentication server
    - centralized server that has usernames, passwords and other authentication information for different people and different services
    - typically used in enterprises and not homes since the latter doesn’t have that much info to store
- What are spam gateways?
    - a separate place where mails suspected to be spam go
    - they will be examined there and make their way into to internal network only if safe and relevant, else will stay there and eventually get deleted
- Expand UTM
    
    Unifies threat management
    
- What is UTM
    - all-in-one security appliance
    - think of it as a next gen firewall
    - performs multiple functions like
        - URL filtering
        - content inspection for malware
        - spam filter
        - router and switch functions
        - firewall
        - bandwidth shaper (to prioritize bandwidth for different tasks)
        - VPN end point
        - Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- What is a load balancer?
    - helps distributes load among different servers so that there is constant availability
    - checks in with serves and if one becomes unresponsive, it removes it and continues operating with remaining
- Features of load balancer
    - configures load on different servers
    - TCP and SSL offloading
    - caching for fast response
    - Prioritization for certain types of traffic
    - content switching: application centric balancing among servers
- Expand SCADA
    
    Supervisory control and data acquisition
    
    aka ICS (industrial control system)
    
- SCADA
    - used for managing specific industrial equipment like power generation equipment, manufacturing equipment, etc
    - have ability to view activities and status real-time for better control
    - requires extensive segmentation so they are on their own network separated from the rest. This is because any problem with this affects large amounts of systems and will be difficult to resolve
- What are legacy systems?
    - once a service is installed in a data center, it’s very hard to remove it
    - they are very old systems, but still have some important service running on them
    - they may have these services running on a very old software or hardware and hence hard to repair
