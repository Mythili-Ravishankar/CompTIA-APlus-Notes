- What is virtualization?
    - It is the technology that creates virtual computing environments
    - A VM is a completely self-contained computer that runs within a host
- What is a hypervisor?
    - The software that creates and runs virtualization
    - It allocates and controls sharing of resources like CPU, RAM, storage, etc
- Types of hypervisors
    - Type 1:
        - Installed on bare metal hardware, no OS or any other software
        - Typically used in enterprise data centers for large amount of storage and computing power
    - Type 2:
        - Installed within an OS - the OS sits between the machine and the hypervisor
        - Used in personal computers for testing new software/OS etc
- Benefits of virtualization
    - Saves money on hardware, electricity, floor space
    - Easy maintenance and manage because of the less amount of physical stuff
    - Portability to new machines from older hardware
    - Full computing capability: most computers aren’t used to their full potential. By creating VMs, we can push computer to its capacity and take adv of its functionality
    - Disaster recovery: easy to transfer files and create back ups because they are all software
- What is cloud computing?
    - It is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis
    - Cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server
    - But it can do much more than just host data on a remote server, it can extend management of applications and services
- What are the benefits of using the cloud?
    - Scalability - pay as you go and very easily scale up and down
    - Physical space - no need to have infra on site so no need of physical space to host them
    - Security - much more robust than on-premise and no need to constantly monitor
    - Data recover - much more redundancy and robust data recovery measures
    - Maintenance - almost no need of maintenance because the cloud hosting company takes care of it
    - International scope - since it is on the cloud, you can use the servers closest to the geographical area where the service is needed, basically you’re following the sun and deploying in specific parts of the world
    - Cost - you only pay what you use: both with autoscaling as well as subscribe and unsubscribe based on needs, no need to own all that hardware and software all the time
- What are the cloud deployment models?
    - Public (public bus/train) - cloud services by a third party which you rent etc.
    - Private (your own car) - you own all the services and infra either on-site or a remote location
    - Hybrid (taxi) - mix of both: prioritize what you want to yourself and what you want to host on 3rd party hosts
- What are the components of the cloud services?

- What are the cloud service models?
    
    IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    
    - IaaS: aka HaaS. You deploy your own software and manage it and also look after its security, only the hardware is provided to you. You have control over your data. Eg: Web servers. They will give you the server, but you have to manage the website content and management
    - SaaS: Everything is provided to you. You don’t have to install or manage anything, you simply log in and start using the service. Eg: Gmail, Outlook mail, Microsoft 365, etc.
    - PaaS: kinda in between IaaS and SaaS. You are provided with the servers and the building blocks of development, but you need to do the actual development yourself. You can use the premade and provided models to put them together and create the service, and the PaaS takes care of maintaining, security, storage etc. Eg: salesforce

- What is community cloud?
    - When many organizations with the same goal all chip in to purchase cloud equipment . This way they have a private cloud but their costs are shared
    - Think of it as a members only cloud service
- What are some cloud characteristics?
    - Shared resources
    - Metered utilization
    - Rapid elasticity
    - High availability
    - File sync
- What are shared resources in cloud?
    
    You share the resources of the cloud that the provider is giving you with the other clients using the same service. Lets say you are using AWS and they have a data center in Vancouver that you are using. Along with you, multiple companies maybe using AWS at Vancouver so you are essentially sharing resources with them.
    
- Metered utilization
    - Dancy way of saying pay-as-you-go
    - You pay for what you use, costs for uploading, downloading, storage
    - Some could be non-metered where you pay for a clock of storage every month. You can upload download etc as much as you want since you’re not charged for that, but only for how much space you’re taking up. Eg: Drive, Dropbox where you pay a flat fee every month for storage
- Rapid elasticity
    - Flexibility to scale up or down as needed
    - This is seamless to the end user and they’ve no idea these changes are taking place behind the scenes
    - Cloud enables instant resource provisioning
- High availability
    
    Redundancy in cloud helps in its services being always available
    
- File sync
    - Info can be synced across cloud locations anywhere in the world
- What is desktop virtualization?
    - This is when you run your desktop computer on the cloud and so it can be accessed from anywhere through the internet
    - This is called VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) or DaaS
    - All you need is a mouse, keyboard, screen, and ofc the internet and you can access your desktop from anywhere
