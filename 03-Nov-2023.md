- What is virtualization?
    - It is the technology that creates virtual computing environments
    - A VM is a completely self-contained computer that runs within a host
- What is a hypervisor?
    - The software that creates and runs virtualization
    - It allocates and controls sharing of resources like CPU, RAM, storage, etc
- Types of hypervisors
    - Type 1:
        - Installed on bare metal hardware, no OS or any other software
        - Typically used in enterprise data centers for large amount of storage and computing power
    - Type 2:
        - Installed within an OS - the OS sits between the machine and the hypervisor
        - Used in personal computers for testing new software/OS etc
- Benefits of virtualization
    - Saves money on hardware, electricity, floor space
    - Easy maintenance and manage because of the less amount of physical stuff
    - Portability to new machines from older hardware
    - Full computing capability: most computers aren’t used to their full potential. By creating VMs, we can push computer to its capacity and take adv of its functionality
    - Disaster recovery: easy to transfer files and create back ups because they are all software
- What is cloud computing?
    - It is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis
    - Cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server
    - But it can do much more than just host data on a remote server, it can extend management of applications and services
- What are the benefits of using the cloud?
    - Scalability - pay as you go and very easily scale up and down
    - Physical space - no need to have infra on site so no need of physical space to host them
    - Security - much more robust than on-premise and no need to constantly monitor
    - Data recover - much more redundancy and robust data recovery measures
    - Maintenance - almost no need of maintenance because the cloud hosting company takes care of it
    - International scope - since it is on the cloud, you can use the servers closest to the geographical area where the service is needed, basically you’re following the sun and deploying in specific parts of the world
    - Cost - you only pay what you use: both with autoscaling as well as subscribe and unsubscribe based on needs, no need to own all that hardware and software all the time
- What are the cloud deployment models?
    - Public (public bus/train) - cloud services by a third party which you rent etc.
    - Private (your own car) - you own all the services and infra either on-site or a remote location
    - Hybrid (taxi) - mix of both: prioritize what you want to yourself and what you want to host on 3rd party hosts
- What are the components of the cloud services?

- What are the cloud service models?
    
    IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    
    - IaaS: aka HaaS. You deploy your own software and manage it and also look after its security, only the hardware is provided to you. You have control over your data. Eg: Web servers. They will give you the server, but you have to manage the website content and management
    - SaaS: Everything is provided to you. You don’t have to install or manage anything, you simply log in and start using the service. Eg: Gmail, Outlook mail, Microsoft 365, etc.
    - PaaS: kinda in between IaaS and SaaS. You are provided with the servers and the building blocks of development, but you need to do the actual development yourself. You can use the premade and provided models to put them together and create the service, and the PaaS takes care of maintaining, security, storage etc. Eg: salesforce

- What is community cloud?
    - When many organizations with the same goal all chip in to purchase cloud equipment . This way they have a private cloud but their costs are shared
    - Think of it as a members only cloud service
- What are some cloud characteristics?
    - Shared resources
    - Metered utilization
    - Rapid elasticity
    - High availability
    - File sync
- What are shared resources in cloud?
    
    You share the resources of the cloud that the provider is giving you with the other clients using the same service. Lets say you are using AWS and they have a data center in Vancouver that you are using. Along with you, multiple companies maybe using AWS at Vancouver so you are essentially sharing resources with them.
    
- Metered utilization
    - Dancy way of saying pay-as-you-go
    - You pay for what you use, costs for uploading, downloading, storage
    - Some could be non-metered where you pay for a clock of storage every month. You can upload download etc as much as you want since you’re not charged for that, but only for how much space you’re taking up. Eg: Drive, Dropbox where you pay a flat fee every month for storage
- Rapid elasticity
    - Flexibility to scale up or down as needed
    - This is seamless to the end user and they’ve no idea these changes are taking place behind the scenes
    - Cloud enables instant resource provisioning
- High availability
    
    Redundancy in cloud helps in its services being always available
    
- File sync
    - Info can be synced across cloud locations anywhere in the world
- What is desktop virtualization?
    - This is when you run your desktop computer on the cloud and so it can be accessed from anywhere through the internet
    - This is called VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) or DaaS
    - All you need is a mouse, keyboard, screen, and ofc the internet and you can access your desktop from anywhere
 
  - What is a laptop docking station?
    
    A laptop docking station is hardware that allows you to extend the capabilities of your laptop by connecting it to multiple monitors and peripherals. It acts as an expansion port, providing power and extra data ports so that you can expand on the features of your laptop. The most common type of dock is a desktop model with multiple video, USB, audio and other input/output ports. This lets you plug in accessories such as an HD monitor, mouse, keyboard, printer or even an external hard drive.
    
- What is a port replicator?
    
    May seem similar to docking station but it is not. It is basically a big USB hub.
    
- What all could be inside a laptop monitor?
    
    Wifi antenna, webcam, webcam lights, touch sceens etc
    
- What are the 2 types of phones?
    - CDMA: Code division multiple access. They don’t use SIM cards. They worked on the basis of some code that is common to you and the person you’re communicating with and filters out codes that are not relevant to you.
    - GSM: global system for mobile communications. They use SIM cards.

- What are the parts of a laser printer?
    - Imaging drum: it is the main part of the printer that effectively ‘prints’ onto paper. Laser writes on it, it picks up toner, and transfers the toner to paper. Could be combined with cartridge or separate
    - Fuser assembly: uses heat and pressure to melt toner and affix it to paper
    - Transfer belt and roller: used in color printers. There will be different color toners (CMYK). The TB and R are responsible for picking up these diff colors and putting them onto the drum
    - Pickup roller: helps pick up single sheets of paper from the printer tray into the printer. If problems with no sheet or multiple sheets being picked up, this guy is the prob and needs to be repaired or replaces
    - Separation pads: Works in conjunction with pickup roller to pick up the top sheet from the paper tray
    - Duplexing assembly: for 2 side printing, it doesn’t happen simultaneously. One side is printed, and there is some hardware that flips the paper to the other side and then prints it to finally give a 2 sided printed page as the output.
- Explain the laser printing process
    1. Processing: the print job actually comes in and is stored on local memory on the actual printer itself
    2. Charging: where the primary corona puts a really strong negative charge on the drum, clearing it and preparing it for the incoming image
    3. Exposing: the laser begins writing onto that photosensitive drum, and it creates a positive charge wherever the laser light hits the negatively charged drum.
    4. Developing. the toner (negative by default) comes out of the cartridge and sticks to the positive parts of the drum, essentially sticking to the drum photosensitive drum (because negative and positive attract)
    5. Transfer: now the toner from the drum sticks to the paper which is passing through the printer (ie toner transferred from drum to paper)
    6. Fusing: where a fusing assembly using heat and pressure presses the toner into the paper to affix it permanently to the paper
    7. Cleaning: even though most of the toner is transferred to the paper, some residue will be on the drum. The cleaning process involves some kinda rubber scraper that will take out all the excess toner making the drum clean for the next round of printing
- Whare are some steps in maintaining a laser printer?
    - Clean periodically according to specified documentation
    - Replace toner when needed, and you may usually get a drum too with it if the 2 are combined for your printer type
    - Maintenance kits: they have some spare parts that you can use to replace older ones, although the contents and how to use them vary for every type of printer so read carefully
    - Calibration - this is for color printers, if there are problems with how much of each color is being picked up etc. Calibrate the transfer roller and belt by following documentation and you should be fine
- Explain parts of an inkjet printer
    - Ink cartridge - contains different colors (CMYK) of ink
    - Print head - this is the part that transfers the ink from cartridge to paper; this could be integrated into the cartridge or be separate
    - Feed rollers - pick up and feed paper into printer, must be clean. Duplexing is for 2 side printing same as laser printer
    - Carriage and belt - diff colour cartridges are places in a carriage and this is pulled back and forth across the paper by a belt to make the printing happen
- What are some steps in maintaining an inkjet printer?
    - Cleaning print heads - they tend to get clogged and ruin the output. Many printers run a cleaning process daily automatically but you can do it manually too
    - Replace cartridges - replace when empty. Some have separate for each color, some combine.
    - Calibrate - for correct overlap of colours. Can run a calibrate round which will print a set of colours based on which you can modify how much of each color is taken for printing
    - Clear jams - paper jams! Remove paper tray, remove loose paper. Try not to rip the paper. Make sure no pieces of paper are stuck inside the printer.
- Explain impact printer
    - aka dot-matrix printer
    - as the name goes, it makes an impact on paper to print
    - print head has pins that press against a ribbon to make a mark on paper
    - you can actually see the dots in this image:
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b53f5d3f-344b-4840-94bc-8498f3af413e/b1801c78-6271-4f87-8e1d-fae6e2e36632/Untitled.png)
    
    - it prints multiple pages at the same time
    - Print head: made up of pins which presses the ribbon
    - Ribbon: made of fabric, sits between pins and paper, pins press this onto the paper to print. Usually one long never ending (looped) ribbon.
    - Tractor feed paper: continuous paper that has perforations to manually separate them after printing. Have holes on the side which have to aligned perfectly with the printer which will pull them as the printing happens
- Impact printer maintenance
    - Replace ribbon: when ink on ribbon is consumed, print will become lighter, so replace. Fairly simple process
    - Print head replacement: constant hitting the ribbon may eventfully cause it to fail, so replace
    - Replace paper: not as easy as replacing in other printers since there is no paper tray and it is one very long sheet of paper. Align paper holes with the feed. Nothing should be in the way of the paper as it gets pulled into the printer
- Explain thermal printers
    - No ink, no toner, just heat!
    - typically receipt printers at POS
    - if paper left in sun, entire thing turns black
    - don’t use this for archiving info
    - Feed assembly: has gears to pull paper through the printer
    - Heating element: doesn’t move, but paper moves and the heating element will heat diff parts of the paper to print
    - Thermal paper: turns black/blue when heated. It’s paper covered with a chemical that makes it heat sensitive. aka thermochromic paper
- Thermal printer maintenance
    - Replace paper: quite cheap, easy process. Pick exactly the right size, can’t substitute size or regular paper.
    - Clean heating element: clean with cleaning pen/water or whatever is recommended. Swab gently.
    - Remove debris: Gets lots of paper dandruff. Blow out with compressed air
    - Heat sensitive paper: don’t put in hot areas, don’t use for archiving info
- 3D printer
    - prints 3D from electronic model
    - builds the object in multiple layers so called additive manufacturing
    - helps rapid prototyping, even helps in space for specialized part
    - Filament printing: melt filament and add layers to make the object
    - Resin printing: smoother and finer details than filament. Pool of liquid resin in a basin which is hardened in required shapes to add layers to the build platform. Handle resins and dispose them carefully since they could be hazardous.
    - Print head: flat adhesive on top/bottom. Needs to be fully flat and clean, needs to be very still while printing
