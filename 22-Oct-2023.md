- How would you find the MAC address in Windows?
    
    Go to command line and type ipcongif /all and in the results look for ‘Physical Address’. That is your MAC address
    
- What is a LAN?
    
    It’s a network of devices connected together in one physical location like a building, office, or home
    
- How are computers on a LAN connected to one another?
    - If wired, then through the ethernet technology
    - If wireless, then through the 802.11 technology
- What is the ethernet?
    
    It is a technology used to connect multiple devices on a LAN. It has protocols to control passing information between this devices and avoid simultaneous transmission

- What is the size of a MAC address and how is it represented in different OSs?
    
    It’s 48 bits long, represented as a 12 digit hexadecimal number. It’s format is
    
    - Windows: XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX
    - Linux and Apple: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    - Cisco: XXXX.XXXX.XXXX
- What are the 2 parts of MAC address?
    
    The first 3 octets (1 hd value = 8 bits which is an octet/byte) are the OUI which is Organizationally unique ID) which specifies the manufacturer of the machine. 
    
    The last 3 are called the unique identifier which is the set that makes the MAC address unique for the machine 
    
- How does 12 hexadecimal become 48 bits in a MAC address?
    
    Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. The MAC address has 12 h, so 12x4 = 48 bits
    
- Do you need the IP address of a device to communicate with it if both of you are on the same LAN?
    
    Before the TCP/IP model came along and became so popular, there were protocols that relied on only the MAC addresses to communicate with devices on the same LAN. But with TCP/IP model becoming so widely used, now, even devices on the same LAN use the IP of a device to communicate with it. ARP (address resolution protocol) helps map the IP of a device to it’s MAC. 
    
    Lets say A wants to talk to B and they both are on the same LAN. 
    
    So, first A will identify the IP of B, and from this, you can make out if they are on the same LAN as you. If yes, you send out an ARP request, basically asking B to give you its MAC. Once you have B’s MAC, you can send out information to it.
