- Why is there no antenna on laptops and mobiles even though they use wireless technology?
    
    The antenna is built into the cases or hardware of the laptop/phone to enables using wireless stuff, so they don’t need antennas.
    
- Expand SSID
    
    Service set identifier
    
- What is a WAP?
    
    A WAP is a bridge that helps connect the wireless 802.11 technology with the ethernet networks. This device has only one ethernet port. 
    
    However, these days there are devices which is a switch, a router, a WAP, etc all at the same time. In such cases, you may see one having more than one ethernet port to support its other functions.
    
- What is infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode in wireless connections?
    
    Infrastructure mode is when there is a WAP and devices connect to it. Regular wifi kinda thing.
    
    Ad-hoc mode is when there is no WAP. A set of computers together, one of them becomes a WAP of sorts and the rest connect to it, like setting up a LAN but wirelessly. Imaging wanting to play counterstrike inside a flight with fellow passengers, all with laptops but no internet of any sort. 
    
- What are ISM bands?
    - ISM = industrial, scientific, and medical
    - ISM bands are portions of the radio spectrum that are reserved for industrial, scientific, and medical purposes
    - The 802.11 technology runs on ISM bands 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
- What are the 2 major frequencies on which the 802.11 technology works?
    
    2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
    
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 2.4 GHz band?
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Has the longest signal range from 150 feet (45 meters) indoors to 300 feet (92 meters) outdoors.
    - Can pass through walls and other solid objects.
    
    Disadvantages
    
    - The long signal range also increases the chances of Wi-Fi traffic being intercepted by cybercriminals.
    - Includes a limited number of channels. Can range from 11 to 14 channels, depending on regulations in the country of use.
    - Can experience network traffic congestion and interference with other Wi-Fi networks and wireless technologies, such as BlueTooth, that overlap the 2.4 GHz frequency bands.
    - Microwave ovens also work in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and can cause Wi-Fi interference.
    - Under specific conditions, the maximum achievable data rate is 600 Mbps.
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 5 GHz band?
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Includes significantly more channels than 2.4 GHz.
    - Experiences fewer interference problems and less wireless network traffic congestion than 2.4 GHz.
    - Can achieve over 2 Gbps data transfer speeds under specific conditions.
    
    Disadvantages
    
    - The wireless range is limited to 50 feet (12 meters) indoors and 100 feet (30 meters) outdoors.
    - Does not penetrate walls and other solid objects as well as 2.4 GHz.
- What are the different 802.11 standards and their bands and speeds?

- What is MIMO and its types
    - MIMO = multiple input multiple output
    - SU MIMO = single user MIMO. This is when a router can communicate with multiple devices but only one device at a time. This meant that each device had to wait its turn to communicate with the router. So if you add too many devices to the network, inevitably there will be congestion leading to buffering and slower speeds.
    - MU MIMO = multiple user MIMO. This is when a router can communicate with multiple devices all at the same time. You need minimum wifi 5 (802.11 ac) to support this. The devices connected to this also needs to support this. This is almost like each device has its own router.
    - MU-MIMO uses beamforming which is a technique of sending a signal in a specific direction, so the signal is strong, Older ones didn’t use beamforming so they used to send signals uniformly in all directions making them weaker.
    - Analogy. Beamforming = torch light; no beamforming = lantern
- How would you configure long range fixed wireless networks?
    - Using antennas
    - a WAP in a small area like a house may give 40-50m coverage
    - For bigger settings like offices, you may need fixed directional antennas with increased strengths
    - Indoors - lots of objects and people and signal could get lost, but outdoors not so much
    - You can use something like a Yagi antenna which is highly directional and can provide focused point-to-point connection between the antenna in one building and the other
- What are the regulations of using wireless connections?
    - Each country has different regulations so check those before installing
    - You may be able to get license to use other frequencies outside of 2.4 and 5 GHz
    - There are regulations of *which frequency* you can use, *where* you can use them, and what the *signal strength* can be.
    - If you need to install outdoor antenna, use safety measures to protect it from lightning etc. Better to call an expert to do this stuff
