- What is virtualization?
    - It is the technology that creates virtual computing environments
    - A VM is a completely self-contained computer that runs within a host
- What is a hypervisor?
    - The software that creates and runs virtualization
    - It allocates and controls sharing of resources like CPU, RAM, storage, etc
- Types of hypervisors
    - Type 1:
        - Installed on bare metal hardware, no OS or any other software
        - Typically used in enterprise data centers for large amount of storage and computing power
    - Type 2:
        - Installed within an OS - the OS sits between the machine and the hypervisor
        - Used in personal computers for testing new software/OS etc
- Benefits of virtualization
    - Saves money on hardware, electricity, floor space
    - Easy maintenance and manage because of the less amount of physical stuff
    - Portability to new machines from older hardware
    - Full computing capability: most computers aren’t used to their full potential. By creating VMs, we can push computer to its capacity and take adv of its functionality
    - Disaster recovery: easy to transfer files and create back ups because they are all software
- What is cloud computing?
    
    Cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server.
    
    But it can do much more than just host data on a remote server, it can extend management of applications and services.

  - What are the purposes of virtualization?
    1. Legacy software and OS: if an application runs on some old OS, use a VM to use that OS and run the app and use the latest or desired OS on your actual host computer
    2. Cross-platform: run multiple OSs simultaneously, save resources and time, move seamlessly between OSs
    3. Sandboxing: isolated testing envt, no connection to real world so no consequences, try code, break code, nobody gets hurt. You can also take snapshots of prev versions and roll back to them in case something goes wrong
- What are the resource requirements for virtualization?
    - CPU: Intel - Virtualization Technology (VT), If AMD then AMD-V
    - RAM: have above and beyond the host’s requirements
    - Disk space: to store OS images and data
    - Network: configure each guest as required
- What are the security requirements for virtualization?
    1. Hypervisor security:
        1. VM escaping: Malware compromises hypervisor and jumps from one guest OS to another
        2. if many customers are hosted on a single hypervisor, it can steal data from all of them if compromised
    2. Guest OS security:
        1. Use traditional security measures just like you would for a regular computer like firewall, anti-virus etc
        2. Don’t trust 3rd party built VMs because they could be rogue and steal stuff from your host as well
- What are the network requirements for virtualization?
    1. Shared network address: guest uses same as host, has a private address internally 
    2. Bridged network: separate IP, works just like regular IP on a regular computer
    3. Private address: like APIPA, no communication with internet but yes with internal; network devices
