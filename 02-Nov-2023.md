- What is virtualization?
    - It is the technology that creates virtual computing environments
    - A VM is a completely self-contained computer that runs within a host
- What is a hypervisor?
    - The software that creates and runs virtualization
    - It allocates and controls sharing of resources like CPU, RAM, storage, etc
- Types of hypervisors
    - Type 1:
        - Installed on bare metal hardware, no OS or any other software
        - Typically used in enterprise data centers for large amount of storage and computing power
    - Type 2:
        - Installed within an OS - the OS sits between the machine and the hypervisor
        - Used in personal computers for testing new software/OS etc
- Benefits of virtualization
    - Saves money on hardware, electricity, floor space
    - Easy maintenance and manage because of the less amount of physical stuff
    - Portability to new machines from older hardware
    - Full computing capability: most computers aren’t used to their full potential. By creating VMs, we can push computer to its capacity and take adv of its functionality
    - Disaster recovery: easy to transfer files and create back ups because they are all software
- What is cloud computing?
    
    Cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server.
    
    But it can do much more than just host data on a remote server, it can extend management of applications and services.
