- What are laptop batteries usually made of?
    
    Lithium ion (Li-ion) or Lithium ion polymer (LiPo)
    
- What is the battery memory effect? Do laptop batteries have this?
    - Reduction in longevity of battery with use due to incomplete discharge
    - It does not because it’s usually seen in nickel and cadmium batteries but laptops typically have lithium
    - But with time it will need to be replaced due to high use
- What are the ways you would replace laptop storage?
    - sometimes open full case and look at the memory slots and change
    - sometimes specific are for storage with specific covers/windows, so open just that and make needed changes
    - usually a couple screws and slide the storage drive out; m.2 even easier since it’s smaller
- Explain migrating from HDD to SSD
    - you’d do that since SSDs are much faster and reliable so it’s almost like getting a new laptop by making just that one change
    1. Install OS on SSD, move documents between drives and install required applications, but this can be time consuming
    2. the second method is better where you create a clone/image of the hard drive and move the image to the SSD. No need of OS, and you move everything (including apps) in one shot. Many third-party and open source options to make this image
- What are wireless cards in laptops?
    - Cards that enable wireless connectivity like 802.11 or bluetooth
    - could also have WWAN cards (wireless WAN) where you connect to a cellular network when others aren’t available
    - cards will have slots to connect antenna
- How are biometrics used in laptops?
    - For authentication
    - Needs software and hardware
    - Software to recognize, and hardware to actually input the info like your face (camera) or fingerprint (fingerprint reader)
- What is a digitizer?
    - converts analog signals such as the ones given by a stylus into electrical signals for the computer to understand
    - this could also be used in touch screen where it senses our touch and converts the signal for the computer/laptop/mobile
- What is serial communication and what are some serial interfaces?
    - Serial communication is data transmission through cables one bit at a time
    - DB-9: 9-pin connection that’s used for sending RS-232 signals. DB-9 used for communication with switches, routers etc
    - these were used extensively before USB but now you would hardly find it. If you do, you may need to use a USB to DB-9 converter
- Active stylus
    - stylus but with additional features like sensing pressure sensitivity, programmable buttons etc
    - unlike regular styluses/touch pens, these need to be compatible with device, eg: only apple pencil can be used on iPad
- Drawing pad
    - for devices that don’t have touch screen capabilities
    - use drawing pad which is the digitizer and its stylus and convert any device to support this
    - third party drawing pads compatible with multiple OSs are a good choice for this
- TRRS
    - one of the ways to connect wired headsets - it refers to tip-ring-ring-sleeve and looks like this
    - other ways include USB or lightning in case of Apple and ofc bluetooth for wireless
