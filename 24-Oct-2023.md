- What is the IP address?
    - It’s a unique identifier assigned to every device on a network.
    - It has 2 parts to it - the network ID (similar to street name) and host ID (similar to house number)
    - IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long - 4 octets separated by 3 periods. Eg: 192.165.23.56
    - All these 4 octets can be only between 0 and 255. They are all basically binary numbers but converted to dotted decimals for us humans to be able to read it.
    - IPv6 are 128 bits long represented in hexadecimals. Eg: 4000:130F:09C0:0000:0000:276E
- What is a subnet?
    - It is network within a network, ie a subnetwork. It is a logical partition of an IP network into multiple smaller networks.
    - Subnetting is done to relieve congestion of network so that information can be shared only among relevant system, thereby reducing unnecessary traffic throughout the network.
    - Subnetting also helps improve network security by allowing admins to quarantine compromised sections of the network
- What is a subnet mask?
    
    A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting **host bits to all 0s** and setting **network bits to all 1s.** In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses. The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” address is always assigned to a network address.
    
    Class A IPs have a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
    
    Class B IPs have a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
    
    Class C IPs have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
    
    Subnet masks are used to differentiate IPs on the same LAN and outside traffic and are used only in IPv4 addresses. IPv6 takes care of this using prefixes.
    
- What are the IPv4 classes?
    
    There are 5 IPv4 classes A to E. A to C are important to know because D and E are not used for commercial purposes.

    To know the class of an IP address, you can look at the first octet, and then refer to the following table: - memorise this table

- DHCP expand
    
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    
- What is the DHCP protocol? How does it work?
    - Every computer needs to have an IP if it wants to get on a network. This is done in 2 ways - static and dynamic.
    - In the early days, there used to be static where a user assigned an IP to the computer. But this is very tedious and also higher chances of giving 2 computers the same IP resulting in IP conflict.
    - Nowadays, it is dynamic, where a DHCP server automatically assigns IP. Along with an IP, it also give the computer a subnet mask, a default gateway, and a DNS server.
    - Most of the times, under IPv4 properties, you would check the option to obtain IP automatically. In a case where you don’t you can assign your own and it will be static.
        
        The DHCP process happens through 4 steps called DORA:
        
        1. D: Discover - the client tries to discover a nearby DHCP server
        2. O: Offer - the server offers an IP to the client
        3. R: Request - the client requests to lock in the offer
        4. A: Acknowledge - the server acknowledges offer and confirms
- What is DHCP scope?
    
    It’s a range of IPs that a DHCP server can hand out. This range is set by the network admin and is customizable
    
- What is DHCP lease?
    - When a computer gets an IP from the DHCP server, it doesn’t own the IP, it is on lease
    - Lease is the amount of time an IP address is assigned to a computer
    - Leases exist to ensure the DHCP does not run out of IP addresses.
    - If a computer leaves the network and it takes the IP with it, then any new incoming computer to that network cannot use the IP address. If this keeps repeating then at some point the DHCP will run out of IP addresses to give out. That’s why the lease.
    - During the lease period, computers will ask the DHCP server to keep renewing their leases thereby maintaining their IP addresses. But if the computer leaves the network, it will not be able to ask for renewal, the lease will expire, and now the IP address will be back in the pool for the server to give it to any new system on the network.
- What is DHCP reservation?
    - A reservation ensures that a specific computer or device (identified by its MAC address) will always be given the same IP address.
    - Usually, reservations are not given to regular computers, they are more often given to printers, routers, servers etc to maintain their IP addresses.
- Where does the DHCP service run?
    - It could run on big servers like a MS or Linux server
    - But for offices and homes, the service is typically built into the router
- What are the commands to release and renew your DHCP lease on Windows?
    
    ipconfig /release    
    
    ipconfig /renew   
    
- Explain the DHCP renewal process
    - When a computer receives an IP address from the DHCP server, a timer starts which is the length of the lease of the IP
    - Typically when this lease ends, the IP address would go back to the server. But there are other timers that take care of this
    - T1 - checks in with DHCP halfway through the lease period and lets the server know that it wants to keep the address. Then the lease will get renewed
    - Lets say DHCP was down during that halfway T1 time check in, then at 87.5% of the lease period, the T2 time looks for other DHCP servers and tries to renew its lease.
