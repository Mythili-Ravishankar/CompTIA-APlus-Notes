- Explain power over ethernet
    - When devices get their power and data through their ethernet cable, it is called PoE
    - The ethernet cables supply power through the copper wires in them, thereby eliminating the need for a separate power cable
    - For this to work, you need a PSE (power sourcing equipment) and a PD (powered device) that is compatible with PoE
- What is a PoE injector?
    - The PSE is usually a PoE switch. If you donâ€™t have a PoE switch, you can use a PoE injector which converts a non-PoE device into a PoE device
    - The injector has 2 ports, one for LAN and another for power. Switch to LAN port. PoE receiver to power port, and injector into power socket:

- What are the advantages of PoE?
    - Convenience: no need for additional electrical outlets, making it convenient to power network devices
    - Cost savings: PoE eliminates the need for separate power cables and outlets, resulting in cost savings in installation and maintenance
    - Flexibility: PoE allows devices to be placed anywhere within the reach of an Ethernet cable, without being limited by the availability of power outlets
    - Centralized power management: PoE enables centralized power management and monitoring of network devices
    - Safety: PoE adheres to strict safety standards and provides low-voltage power, reducing the risk of electrical hazards
- What is active and passive PoE?
    - Active: smart PoE switch, knows how much power each device needs and sends only that much
    - Passive: dumb PoE. Sends same amount to everyone, could damage devices if you connect without checking voltage
- What are the different PoE standards?
    
    
    - IEEE 802.3af: This standard provides up to 15.4 watts of DC power per port.
    - IEEE 802.3at: Also known as PoE+, this standard provides up to 30 watts of DC power per port.
    - IEEE 802.3bt: Also known as PoE++, this standard provides up to 60 watts or 100 watts of DC power per port, depending on the type.
