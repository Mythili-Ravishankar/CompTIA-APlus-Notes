- Why are they called cellular networks?
    
    Because the geographical area is separated into cells with antennas in the edges to provide coverage
    
- 2G networks
    - The original cellular networks\
    - Great for voice but not for data
    - Had GSM and CDMA
- Expand SIM (cards)
    
    Subscriber identity module
    
- 3G
    - 3rd gen into in 1998
    - more data capabilities and speeds
    - led to new capabilities of phones like GPS, video streaming, mobile television
- 4G - LTE
    - LTE = long term evolution
    - converged GSM and CDMA providers
    - based on GSM and EDGE
    - EDGE = enhanced data rates for gsm Evolution
    - supports upto 150Mbit/sec
    - LTE-A = lte advanced supported 300 MBit/sec
- 5G
    - launched in 2020
    - much higher speeds upto 10 Gbits/sec and slower speeds of 100-900 MBit/sec
    - had impact on IoT devices: many different devices on the network so bandwidth and speed helps improve their capabilities
- What are PRL updates?
    - PRL = preferred roaming lists
    - helps phone know where are the towers for its network
    - it could also be updated OTA (over the air)
    - usually happens automatically on the OS of the phone
- GPS overview
    - 30 satellites created by US defence
    - phone needs signals from minimum 4 satellites to help navigate
    - determines location based on timing differences of the signals from these satellites: altitude latitude longitude
    - we canâ€™t see signals, but the results on maps, etc
    - phone uses GPS, wifi, cellular networks to precisely determine where we are
- MDM/MAM overview
    - corporate  scenarios when you want to manage multiple employees phones , even helps in BYOD
    - can control policies on apps, data, camera, etc
    - can partition device for personal and official use in BYOD
    - can have strict security features like forcing screen locks, PINs etc
    - you can also do things like
        1. corporates email configuration
        2. two-factor authentication
        3. corporate applications
- What are firewalls?
    - Network security devices that monitor traffic to or from your network. It allows or blocks traffic based on a defined set of security rules.
    - These rules are usually based on IP and port numbers
    - Usually work in transport layer 4 of OSI model, sometimes also layer 7 application
    - Can also act as a tunnel to encrypt data between 2 sites
    - Can also act as a proxy server
    - Can also act as a router (layer 3)
- What is ONT
    - Optical network terminal: fiber
    - Connects fiber network from ISP to copper to use inside home
    - usually called demarc (demarcation point) because it delineates the ISP network from internal network
    - Demarc is important to define line of responsibility between the 2 parties
- Expand OFDMA
    
    Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
    
    - OFDMA solves the congestion problem by accommodating multiple users at the same time and allocating bandwidth more efficiently.
