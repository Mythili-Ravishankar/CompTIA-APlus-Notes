- What happens if your DHCP is down?
    - If DHCP is down, APIPA kicks in which is a fall back if the computer can’t find an IP address
    - APIPA = Automatic Private IP Addressing
    - APIPA by default gives a 169.254.X.X address, so if there’s a problem on the network and your computer’s IP address is in this format, you can know that DHCP is the problem
    - when on APIPA, all the computers in that LAN which also have APIPA can all still connect with each other, but you can’t get on the internet  because the router will have a fixed non-APIPA address so it can’t take you out
    - when the DHCP is down and the computers on the same subnet kick into APIPA, they all send out a broadcast to male sure that 2 devices don’t end up with the same APIPA address
- What is the range of APIPA address?
    
    169.254.0.1 - 255.254
    
- What is APIPA’s subnet mask?
    
    255.255.0.0 (Class B)
    
- Write this fe80:0000:0000:1234:0000:0000:0000:1234 in shorthand
    
    fe80:0:0:1234::1234
    
- What is the link local and global address?
    - Link-local address is used for local connections only. It is similar to APIPA where you get an address and other computers on the same LAN with similar assigned addresses can communicate with each other. This always starts with fe80
    
    - Global addresses are used to connect to the internet
- What is an IPv6 address?
    
    It is the next generation of IP adresses that are 128-bit hexadecimals
    
    They have been made since we ran out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 will not run out anytime soon because they can make 340 undecillion address ie 340 followed by 36 digits!
    
- What are the parts of an IPv6 address?
    - Of the 128 bits, the first 64 are the network ID and the remaining 64 are the host ID
    - the last 16 bits in the network ID are used for subnetting
- What are network ports?
    - They are logical connections used by programs and services to exchange information. They are not physical connections
    - Ports have unique numbers to identify them. Range 0-65535
    - For exchanging any info over the internet, you need IP address as well as port number
    - The IP determines location of server while port number determines which service on that server it wants to use
- How would you know the IP and port number in use currently in Windows?
    
    The netstat command
    
- Who assigns port numbers?
    
    IANA - Internet assigned numbers authority
    
- What are the categories of port numbers?
    1. System ports/well-known ports: 0-1023. Eg: 80, 443, 21,etc
    2. User/Registered ports: 1024-49151. Eg: 1527 Oracle, 1433 MS SQL server, etc
    3. Dynamic/Private ports: 49151-65535. Client side free to use, your computers assigns these temporarily when getting services from a server
       
  The first 2 categories are used on servers while the third is used by clients

- FTP port and protocol
    - 20/21
    - It’s the protocol that allows file transfer between systems. It uses the ports 20 and 21.
    - The full functionality of the FTP include list, add, delete files, etc
    - It authenticates with a username and password
- SSH port and protocol
    - 22
    - SSH = secure shell, so it encrypts data hence secure, uses port 22
    - Used to connect remotely to a device using command line
    - Same as telnet but secure
- Telnet port and protocol
    - 23
    - Telecommunication network protocol - uses port 23
    - A way to connect to devices remotely through command line, similar to SSH
    - Same as SSH but not secure because no encryption
- SMTP port and protocol
    - 25
    - SMTP = simple mail transfer protocol, uses port 25
    - used for sending mail from device to mail server
- DNS port and protocol
    - 53
    - Domain name system
    - IP to name
- DHCP port and protocol
    - 67/68
    - Dynamic host configuration protocol
    - Assigns IP addresses automatically
- HTTP port and protocol
    - port 80
    - communication in browser, not encrypted
- POP3 port and protocol
    - 110
    - used for receiving emails, same as IMAP4
    - pop3 = post office protocol
- NetBIOS port and protocol
    - 137/139
    - Older versions of SMB use NetBIOS to communicate to systems using the same OS.
    - This is done on ports 137 to find systems using same OS
    - And 139 to set up a session to transfer data between devices
- IMAP4 port and protocol
    - 143
    - IMAP4 = Internet message access protocol
    - receiving emails, same as POP3
- SNMP port and protocol
    - 161/162
    - SNMP = Simple network management protocol
    - This protocol is used to query network infrastructure for performance details of the network and receive those metrics in return
    - 161 is used for queries
    - You can configure it in a way to alert you if any of the metrics exceeds a certain limits. These alerts aka traps use the port 162
    - SNMP v1, v2 = non encryped
    - DNMP v3 = encrypted
- LDAP port and protocol
    - 389
    - LDAP = lightweight directory access protocol
    - used in MS active directory to query the directory
- HTTPS port and protocol
    - 443
    - communication in browser encrypted, secure
- SMB/CIFS port and protocol
    - 445 - modern version where NetBIOS is not needed
    - protocol that enables communication between devices using the same OS
    - Windows uses SMB = Server message block
    - This is aka CIFS = Common internet file system
- RDP port and protocol
    - 3389
    - RDP = remote desktop protocol
    - Used by Windows for remote sharing
    - Modern windows systems have RDP built in
    - You can control the entire desktop or a particular application using RDP
- Expand TCP and UDP and ICMP
    - TCP = transmission control protocol
    - UDP = User datagram protocol
    - ICMP = Internet control message protocol
- What is TCP?
    - TCP is transmission control protocol
    - It is a connection-oriented and reliable way of sending data.
    - To establish a stable connection, it goes through a 3-way-handshake.
    - The sender sends a packet called SYN (short for synchrpnization)
    - The receiver sends an ACK (short for acknowledge) along with its own SYN.
    - The sender responds with another ACK.
    - TCP assigns numbers to different blocks of data when sent. These numbers help the receiver put the data in the right order and see if any segments are missing.
    - Finally there is something called a checksum associated with each block of data. It’s a result of some calculations done on the block, and when the receiver does the same calculations, if the checksum doesn’t match, it knows something is wrong with the segment
    - By following all this, TCP ends up being a reliable form of sending data
- What is UDP?
    - UDP is User datagram protocol and is connectionless.
    - It is not a reliable way of sending data as it doesn’t have any error handling or checksum features like TCP.
    - It has only one goal and that is to send data regardless of whether or not it is being received at the other end.
    - So why even use it? TCP brings its reliability with latency and resource usage.
    - UDP is used in real-time connections where you can’t afford latency - like video and voice calls and gaming.
    - It doesn’t matter if a few pixels are lost or if the voice is a bit grainy, so UDP works for these purposes since it is very fast and no latency.
