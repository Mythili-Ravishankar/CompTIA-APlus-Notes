- What happens if your DHCP is down?
    - If DHCP is down, APIPA kicks in which is a fall back if the computer can’t find an IP address
    - APIPA = Automatic Private IP Addressing
    - APIPA by default gives a 169.254.X.X address, so if there’s a problem on the network and your computer’s IP address is in this format, you can know that DHCP is the problem
    - when on APIPA, all the computers in that LAN which also have APIPA can all still connect with each other, but you can’t get on the internet  because the router will have a fixed non-APIPA address so it can’t take you out
    - when the DHCP is down and the computers on the same subnet kick into APIPA, they all send out a broadcast to male sure that 2 devices don’t end up with the same APIPA address
- What is the range of APIPA address?
    
    169.254.0.1 - 255.254
    
- What is APIPA’s subnet mask?
    
    255.255.0.0 (Class B)
    
- Write this fe80:0000:0000:1234:0000:0000:0000:1234 in shorthand
    
    fe80:0:0:1234::1234
    
- What is the link local and global address?
    - Link-local address is used for local connections only. It is similar to APIPA where you get an address and other computers on the same LAN with similar assigned addresses can communicate with each other. This always starts with fe80
    
    - Global addresses are used to connect to the internet
- What is an IPv6 address?
    
    It is the next generation of IP adresses that are 128-bit hexadecimals
    
    They have been made since we ran out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 will not run out anytime soon because they can make 340 undecillion address ie 340 followed by 36 digits!
    
- What are the parts of an IPv6 address?
    - Of the 128 bits, the first 64 are the network ID and the remaining 64 are the host ID
    - the last 16 bits in the network ID are used for subnetting
- What are network ports?
    - They are logical connections used by programs and services to exchange information. They are not physical connections
    - Ports have unique numbers to identify them. Range 0-65535
    - For exchanging any info over the internet, you need IP address as well as port number
    - The IP determines location of server while port number determines which service on that server it wants to use
- How would you know the IP and port number in use currently in Windows?
    
    The netstat command
    
- Who assigns port numbers?
    
    IANA - Internet assigned numbers authority
    
- What are the categories of port numbers?
    1. System ports/well-known ports: 0-1023. Eg: 80, 443, 21,etc
    2. User/Registered ports: 1024-49151. Eg: 1527 Oracle, 1433 MS SQL server, etc
    3. Dynamic/Private ports: 49151-65535. Client side free to use, your computers assigns these temporarily when getting services from a server
       
  The first 2 categories are used on servers while the third is used by clients
