- Expand RFID
    
    Radio frequency identification
    
- Where all is RFID used?
    - Access badges, like when you want to open a door
    - Animal tracking: pets or livestock
    - Inventory tracking
- How do RFID chips look?
    - either a small cylindrical chip that is the size of a grain of rice
    - or a flat one where the antenna are on the perimeter and the chip is in the middle

- How do RFID chips get power?
    - Radar technology. The ‘RF’ powers the tag, and ‘ID’ is transmitted back, hence the name RFID
    - Antennas capture the signal and convert it into power which is used by the chip for identification
    - Most work like this, but some may be actively powered by batteries
- Expand NFC
    
    Near field communication
    
- How does NFC work?
    - NFC is a subset of RFID tech but has some slight differences
    - It uses high frequency radio waves using the RFID chips are embedded in smart phones, watches etc and these are used for wireless communication with other devices
    - mainly used in contactless payments like tap phone to pay, or file sharing with other phones, and access token/identity card which are like fobs to open certain doors
    - it is more efficient in short range communication unlike RFID which is great for long distance tracking etc
- Overview of Bluetooth
    - Wireless technology used to connect devices to one another wirelessly
    - Only 2 devices can be connected at once
    - has a short range and is therefore called PAN - personal area network
    - used for connecting peripherals like speakers, earphones, keyboards, mice wirelessly
    - uses the ISM 2.4GHz band same as 802.11
    - works on pairing: some may need a PIN but modern ones usually connect automatically after pairing
- Bluetooth classes
    
    Class 1: 100m
    Class 2: 10m
    Class 3: 1m
    
    Commercial uses may use class 1, but most personal uses like connecting earphones are in the class 2 range

  - LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN, WLAN
    - LAN = group of computers connected by a switch in the same physical location. They all have the same network ID and can communicate with each other.
    - WAN = group of LANs connected to each other using routers. The biggest WAN is the internet. Slower than LANs.
    - MAN = a network in a city; usually bigger than LAN but smaller than WAN
    - PAN = personal area network. Bluetooth, NFC. point-to-point connections usually only between 2 devices
    - WLAN = wireless LAN. uses 802.11 technology within a building or small geographical area. You may have to add extra WAPs to cover larger areas
- Overview of SAN
    - SAN = storage area network. It’s a special high speed network that stores and provides access to large amounts of data. SANs are networks on their own and not connected to LAN thereby not getting affected by LAN traffic.
    - Usually they have very large capacities, use fibre optics and hence very very fast. And because of this obv very expensive, so usually used by large companies
- SAN vs NAS difference
    
    NAS:
    
    - Network attached storage. This is a storage device and doesn’t do anything other than store data
    - this device usually has a set of hard drives in a RAID configuration to provide redundancy, and it also has a NIC to connect to the network and the devices on the network to access that data
    - usually used in homes or small businesses
    - If one component in the NAS breaks, no device can access that data until fixed
    
    SAN:
    
    - SAN is a network on its own. It’s a dedicated network just for storage
    - It has multiple components like disk arrays, switches, and servers, so if one component fails, the other can compensate and so SANs are more fault tolerant
    - SANs are recognized as local hard drive (think D:) by the computers
    
- What are some of the ways to connect to the internet?
    
    Satellite, Fiber, cable, DSL, cellular, WISP
    
- Satellite overview
    - communication with a satellite in space, hence called non-terrestrial
    - usually used in remote areas, on seas/oceans, etc
    - since the distance for the packets to travel is so high, they usually have high latency like 250ms or so, although modern ones have as less as 40ms
    - they are usually affected by rain and speeds reduce if the rain is between receiver and the satellite
- Fiber overview
    - uses light to communicate and has very high speed
    - more expensive than copper since equipment and repair are costlier
    - used widely in WANs but have also made their way into homes and small businesses
- Cable connections overview
    - aka broadband
    - uses same cable as that for cable TV and sends data through that
    - called broadband because multiple frequencies are used to send multiple types of signals through a single cable - like video, audio, data, all through the same cable
    - this is aka DOCSIS - data over cable service interface specification
    - has very high speeds, as high as 1 Gbit/s sometimes
- DSL overview
    - Digital subscriber line: uses telephone lines to provide internet
    - usually ADSL - asymmetric where download is faster than upload
    - the closer you are to the central office of the connection, the higher the speed
    - usually a 10000 foot (~ 3km) from CO for decent speed
- Cellular overview
    - use the cellular networks to provide data along with the regular voice
    - most phones also support hotspot where you can share your internet with another by enabling the 802.11 capabilities
- WISP overview
    - Wireless ISP
    - They provide internet wirelessly
    - they connect fibre to a tower, then use antennas to spread the signal to nearby places and homes can jump onto this and get internet wirelessly
    - they are usually used in rural areas and small populations can connect to these towers and get their internet
    - some use the 802.11 technology, some others use their proprietary methods to spread internet
 
  - What is a proxy server
    - It is a server that acts as a gateway between the user and the internet
    - It retrieves data from the internet on behalf of the user
- What are the benefits of using a proxy server?
    - Privacy: the computer’s IP is hidden and only the proxy’s is visible, so you can browse the internet anonymously
    - Speed: proxy servers have cache memory where the store information about frequently used sites so it’s faster to retrieve that information
    - Bandwidth: for the above reason, it saved bandwidth because it doesn’t have to go all the way to the internet for retrieving data that’s already stored in its cache
    - Activity logging: keeps logs of sites visited, how long was spent there, how frequently you go there etc.
    - Filtering: It can also block certain sites - usually used in offices and schools to not allow students/employees to visit certain sites
    - Security: it examines the response from the internet for malicious content before sending it back to our computers
      
- How would you configure a proxy server?
    In Windows under internet options. You can change port numbers as needed and also add certain IPs to block etc
    
- What is a VPN?
    - it is a service that encrypts your data and protects your identity from the internet
    - it establishes a private network between a user sitting in a remote location and a local network and it does so using some tunneling protocols
    - A VPN concentrator encrypts data when enabled thus protecting our conversation from anyone else
- Uses of VPN?
    - Security: encryption and hiding IP
    - Content: access content in other geographical areas by using the VPN server of that area
    - Remote connection: for employees working from another physical location from their company’s local network
- What are the ways of using VPN?
    - hardware: some routers or firewalls have special VPN capabilities and encryption hardware int hem
    - software: install and use an application available online (paid VPNs are more secure than free ones)
    - client based: built into OSs
