- Expand RFID
    
    Radio frequency identification
    
- Where all is RFID used?
    - Access badges, like when you want to open a door
    - Animal tracking: pets or livestock
    - Inventory tracking
- How do RFID chips look?
    - either a small cylindrical chip that is the size of a grain of rice
    - or a flat one where the antenna are on the perimeter and the chip is in the middle

- How do RFID chips get power?
    - Radar technology. The ‘RF’ powers the tag, and ‘ID’ is transmitted back, hence the name RFID
    - Antennas capture the signal and convert it into power which is used by the chip for identification
    - Most work like this, but some may be actively powered by batteries
- Expand NFC
    
    Near field communication
    
- How does NFC work?
    - NFC is a subset of RFID tech but has some slight differences
    - It uses high frequency radio waves using the RFID chips are embedded in smart phones, watches etc and these are used for wireless communication with other devices
    - mainly used in contactless payments like tap phone to pay, or file sharing with other phones, and access token/identity card which are like fobs to open certain doors
    - it is more efficient in short range communication unlike RFID which is great for long distance tracking etc
- Overview of Bluetooth
    - Wireless technology used to connect devices to one another wirelessly
    - Only 2 devices can be connected at once
    - has a short range and is therefore called PAN - personal area network
    - used for connecting peripherals like speakers, earphones, keyboards, mice wirelessly
    - uses the ISM 2.4GHz band same as 802.11
    - works on pairing: some may need a PIN but modern ones usually connect automatically after pairing
- Bluetooth classes
    
    Class 1: 100m
    Class 2: 10m
    Class 3: 1m
    
    Commercial uses may use class 1, but most personal uses like connecting earphones are in the class 2 range
